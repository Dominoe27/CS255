The DriverPass project focused on designing a robust system to prepare users for driving tests. The client, DriverPass, needed a solution that combined online practice exams with on-road training session management. The system required functionality for user registration, lesson scheduling, progress tracking, and integration with DMV updates. Scalability, security, and cross-platform accessibility were key priorities to ensure a seamless user experience.

I feel I excelled at refining the client's needs into a structured and technically detailed design. The business requirements document captured the system's goals clearly and concisely, while the system design document effectively translated those goals into functional and nonfunctional requirements. I’m proud of how the technical requirements, like role-based access control and integration with cloud infrastructure, were defined to ensure the system’s reliability and scalability.

If I were to revise one aspect of my work, I’d focus on enhancing the user interface (UI) design documentation by incorporating wireframes or low-fidelity mockups. These additions would provide a more noticeable representation of how the system’s features and workflows would look and function from the end-user perspective, bridging the gap between technical design and user interaction.

Addressing user needs was vital to this project. I relied on user stories and the client’s goals to shape every aspect of the system. For instance, the scheduling system was designed to operate on both web and mobile platforms with real-time updates, ensuring accessibility and convenience. Considering user needs is critical because it directly impacts usability, user satisfaction, and the system’s overall adoption rate.

My approach to software design involves carefully moving from high-level requirements to detailed system architecture. I utilized UML diagrams to visualize the system’s structure and workflows clearly. Moving forward, I aim to integrate more iterative design techniques, such as including user feedback earlier through prototypes and usability testing, to refine and validate designs before implementation.
